Omni XcalableMP Compiler README

I. Getting Started
 1. You will need the following softwares to build Omni XcalableMP Compiler.
  - Lex, Yacc
  - A C Compiler (supports C99)
  - A Java Compiler (latest)
  - Apache Ant (1.8.1 or later)
  - A MPI Implementation (supports MPI-2)

 2. Install Step
  A. Configure Omni XcalableMP Compiler
   ex)
    ./configure --prefix=/home/you/XMP

   if your MPI C compiler command is not "mpicc",
    ./configure --with-mpicc=MPICC_CMD

  B. Build the compiler
   ex)
    make
    make install

II. Implementation Status
  This is the alpha release of Omni XcalableMP compiler.
 Some features in the language specification are not supported in this release.
 (You can download the specification of XcalableMP from "http://www.xcalablemp.org".)

 1. Language
  Current version only supports C language.

 2. Global-view Model
  A. Nodes Directive
   <map-type> "regular" is not implemented.

  B. Template Directive
   ':' cannot be used for <template-spec>.
   ("template_fix" ditective is not supported in this release)

  C. Distribute Directive
   "gblock", Block-cyclic("cyclic(w)") distribution is not implemented.

  D. Template_fix Directive
   Not supported in this release

  E. Tasks Directive
   Not supported in this release

  F. Gmove Directive
   gmove between aligned arrays using array section may not work correctly

 I. Reduction Directive
  <defined reduce operations>
   '+', "sum", "SUM"		sum
   '*', "prod", "PROD"		product
   '&', "band", "BAND"		bit-wise and
   "&&", "land", "LAND"		logical and
   '|', "bor", "BOR"		bit-wise or
   "||", "lor", "LOR"		logical or
   '^', "bxor", "BXOR"		bit-wise xor
   "lxor", "LXOR"		logical xor
   "max", "MAX"			maximum
   "min", "MIN"			minimum
   "firstmax", "FIRSTMAX"	first location of maximum
   "firstmin", "FIRSTMIN"	first location of minimum
   "lastmax", "LASTMAX"		last location of maximum
   "lastmin", "LASTMIN"		last location of minumum

 3. Local-view Model
  Local-view model is not supported in this release.

 4. User API Functions (defined in xmp.h)
  A. int xmp_get_rank(void);
   returns MPI rank of the current communicator

  B. int xmp_get_size(void);
   returns MPI size of the current communicator

  C. double xmp_wtime(void);
   returns current time
