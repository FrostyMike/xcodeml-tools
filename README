I. Getting Started
 A. Need the following softwares to build an Omni XcalableMP(XMP) Compiler.
  - Lex, Yacc
  - C and Fortran Compilers (supports C99 and Fortran 2008)
  - C++
  - Java Compiler
  - Apache Ant (1.8.1 or later)
  - MPI Implementation (supports MPI-2)
  - libxml2
  - make
  
  On Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu, 
  the the following packages may be needed to be installed previously:
  ---
  flex gcc gfortran g++ openjdk-7-jdk ant libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin libxml2-dev byacc make
  ---

  On Red Hat and CentOS, 
  the the following packages may be needed to be installed previously:
  ---
  flex gcc gfortran gcc-c++ java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel ant openmpi-devel libxml2-devel byacc make
  ---

  B. If you want to use coarray functions, you install GASNet. (http://gasnet.lbl.gov)
     But when you use the the Omni XMP Compiler on the K computer, you do not need the GASNet.


 2. Install Step
  A. Configure
   1) on a general linux cluster
        $ ./configure --prefix=<INSTALL DIR>

      If your MPI C compiler command is not "mpicc",
        $ ./configure --with-backend-cc=MPICC_CMD

      If you want to use Coarray functions
        $ ./configure --with-gasnetDir=(GASNet install PATH) --with-gasnet-conduit=(GASNet Conduit)

   2) on the K computer
        $ ./configure --target=Kcomputer-linux-gnu

      If you wait to use Coarray functions
        $ ./configure --target=Kcomputer-linux-gnu --enable-fjrdma

    3) on a Cray machine
        $ ./configure --target=Cray-linux-gnu

  B. Build
   e.g.) $ make
         $ make install

  C. Set PATH
    bash) export PATH=<INSTALL DIR>/bin:$PATH
    csh ) set path = ($path <INSTALL DIR>)

  D. Test (Optional)
    $ make tests
    $ make run-tests

    If you want to clean binaries of tests,
    $ make clean-tests 

II. How to use
  A. Compile
   Compile commands are "xmpcc" or "xmpf90".
   e.g.) $ xmpcc -O2 test.c -o test
   
  B. Run
   Please use the command for runing mpi program on your environment.
   e.g.) $ mpirun -np 4 test

  C. Environment Variable
   - XMP_COARRAY_HEAP_SIZE : 
      The heap memory size for using coarray. The default size is 256MB.
      If you want to change this size, please set a value by the Mega Byte.
      e.g.) export XMP_COARRAY_HEAP_SIZE=128

  D. Profiling Options in XMP/C
   XMP supports profiler interfaces of Scalasca and tlog.
   The tlog is included in XMP.
   If you want to use the profiler interface of Scalasca,
   you need to download and compile it from Scalasca website.
   Moreover you need to set an environmental variable as below,
    $ export SCALASCA_HOME = <install-path-scalasca>

   If you want to specify directives for profiling,
   please add "profile" to directive.
     e.g.) #pragma xmp loop on t(i) profile

   When you want to compile XMP source code with profiling,
   please add some of below options.
    -profile         Emit XMP directive profiling code only for specified directives
    -allprofile      Emit XMP directive profiling code for all directives
    -with-scalasca   Emit Scalasca instrumentation
    -with-tlog       Emit tlog insturumentation


III. Implementation Status
 Some features in the language specification are not supported in this release.
 (You can download the specification of XMP from "http://www.xcalablemp.org".)

 Please show http://www.hpcs.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/omni-compiler/xcalablemp/download.html

IV. Note
 In some reasons you failed to build the XMP, especially in the configuration stage, 
 issuing autogen.sh on the top directory would be a solution. 
 And if the build still failed even after issuing the autogen.sh, 
 you should update your autotools (autoconf/automake/libtools) to the latest ones.
